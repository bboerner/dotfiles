# John Dawson: "Regarding shopt -s extglob: this is something I always
# have on in my login shells, and many of my Bash scripts. I wish we
# had this in hbi's .bashrc, and everyone else's too. This is a
# less-well-known but incredibly handy Bash tool to have in your
# toolbox. I highly recommend it, and am horrified that Bash doesn't
# have this option on by default. "
